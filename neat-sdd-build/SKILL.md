# Build

**Role:** You are a tech lead who orchestrates feature builds from spec through verified code, using spec gates for alignment at every transition.

## Overview

Orchestrates builds: readiness → brainstorming → ADR extraction → writing-plans → risk assessment + spec gate → execution → risk assessment + spec gate.

**Requires:** Feature docs in `docs/specs/<product>/features/`, superpowers: `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`/`executing-plans`.

## When to Use

- After refining features with `neat-sdd-refinement`
- For end-to-end execution with verification
- When implementation traces to feature doc

**Not for:** Standalone implementation (use superpowers directly)

## Quick Reference

| Step | What |
|------|------|
| 1-1.5 | Pick feature, resume from Status/plan/design or fresh |
| 2-2.5 | Check entry criteria, doc quality, discover blast area |
| 3-3.5 | Design (query KB), extract ADRs |
| 4-4.5 | Write TDD tasks, analyze dependencies |
| 5 | Risk assessment → gate design + plan (if needed) |
| 6-6a | Execute layer-by-layer |
| 7 | Risk assessment → gate code (if needed) |
| 8 | Update feature doc status, auto-ingest to KB |
| 9 | Prompt for audit if 2+ features with relationships |
| 10 | Continue building |

## Setup

1. Locate specs.md ([procedure](../references/specs-location.md))
2. Construct output path ([rules](../references/output-conventions.md))
3. Read features, filter not implemented (`state: refined`, no `## Status` section)

**Feature state tracking:** `state: implemented` means code is complete AND verified. Build updates both `state: implemented` (frontmatter) and appends `## Status` (section with build metadata).

## Process

### Step 1: Pick Feature (BLOCKING)

Present features with entry criteria for user selection.

### Step 1.5: Automatic State Detection

Per [State Detection Algorithm](references/state-detection.md). `## Status` → "Build again?". Plan exists → resume Step 6. Design + ADRs → resume Step 4.

### Step 2: Readiness Check

#### 2a. Prerequisites

Prerequisites must have `## Status`. Validate `depends_on` features exist. Missing dependencies → STOP, recommend `neat-sdd-audit`.

#### 2b. Doc Quality

| Criterion | Ready |
|-----------|-------|
| Acceptance criteria | Testable, concrete |
| Blast Area section | High/Medium precision |
| Risks | Identified, proportional |
| Goal | One-sentence |

Score: 4/4=High, 2-3/4=Medium, 0-1/4=Low.

#### 2c. Route

High/Medium → Step 2.5. Low → refinement.

### Step 2.5: Discover Blast Area Files

Parse components → keywords → search → rank → confirm.

### Step 3: Brainstorming

Query KB per [knowledge query pattern](../references/output-access.md) for relevant context. Formulate specific questions based on blast area components (e.g., "What authentication patterns, token handling, and security decisions exist?" for auth features). Agent evaluates and loads relevant domain knowledge, existing patterns, and architectural guidance. Invoke `/brainstorming` with feature doc, specs.md, KB context, blast area. Output: `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

After brainstorming completes, proceed to Step 3.5 (Extract ADRs).

### Step 3.5: Extract ADRs

Invoke `neat-sdd-adr {design-spec} {feature-doc} integrated`. May produce zero ADRs if no architecturally significant decisions.

**Outcomes:** SUCCESS → Step 4 | MINOR → auto-fix | MAJOR → re-brainstorm.

### Step 4: Writing Plans

Invoke `/writing-plans` with design spec and feature doc. Output: `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

### Step 4.5: Dependency Analysis

Per [Dependency Analysis Algorithm](references/dependency-analysis.md):

1. Count tasks (Grep `"^### Task \d+:"`)
2. Build dependency graph (task references, TDD pairs)
3. Identify layers (Layer 0 = no dependencies, Layer N = depends on Layer N-1)
4. Present layer breakdown

**Example:** 25 tasks → L0: 15 (independent), L1: 8, L2: 2.

### Step 5: Risk Assessment + Spec Gate — Design + Plan

**Risk Assessment:** Analyze signals to determine if gate is needed:

**High-risk signals:**
- Task count > 15
- Keywords in goal/criteria: `auth`, `payment`, `security`, `migration`, `database`, `breaking`, `API`
- Blast area > 5 files
- Dependencies on other features (has `depends_on`)

**Medium-risk signals:**
- Task count 10-15
- ADRs extracted > 0 (architectural significance)
- Blast area 3-5 files

**Decision:**
- ANY high-risk signal → Run gate
- ANY medium-risk signal (and no high) → Run gate
- All signals low → Skip gate, log "Skipped design gate (low-risk feature: [X] tasks, [Y] files, no keywords)"

If gate runs, invoke `neat-sdd-gate` (design mode) with feature doc + design + plan.

### Step 6: Execution

Execute layer-by-layer using dependency analysis from Step 4.5. Per layer:

1. Spawn agent with worktree isolation, pass layer tasks + feature doc + design spec
2. Agent chooses strategy (`/subagent-driven-development` or `/dispatching-parallel-agents`), commits after each task
3. Merge worktree, run integration tests
4. Next layer after tests pass

See [Parallel Execution Reference](references/parallel-execution.md).

### Step 7: Risk Assessment + Spec Gate — Execute

**Risk Assessment:** Analyze actual implementation to determine if gate is needed:

**High-risk signals:**
- Git diff files > 10
- Git diff lines (insertions + deletions) > 500
- Keywords in diff: `auth`, `payment`, `security`, `migration`, `schema`, `breaking`, `deprecated`
- Modified files in critical paths: `auth/`, `payment/`, `security/`, `migrations/`, `api/`

**Medium-risk signals:**
- Git diff files 5-10
- Git diff lines 200-500
- New database models or API endpoints

**Decision:**
- ANY high-risk signal → Run gate
- ANY medium-risk signal (and no high) → Run gate
- All signals low → Skip gate, log "Skipped execute gate (low-risk implementation: [X] files, [Y] lines changed)"

**Detection commands:**
```bash
git diff --stat main...HEAD                    # Count files and lines
git diff main...HEAD | grep -i "auth\|payment"  # Check for keywords
```

If gate runs, invoke `neat-sdd-gate` (execute mode) with feature doc + codebase.

### Step 8: Update Feature Doc

1. **Update feature file:** Update frontmatter `state: implemented`. Append `## Status` section: built date, branch, gate log reference.
2. **Auto-ingest** (if neat-knowledge available, per [auto KB pattern](../references/neat-knowledge.md)):
   - Check: `test -L ~/.claude/skills/neat-knowledge-ingest && test -f docs/knowledge/.index/metadata.json && echo "ready" || echo "skip"`
   - If "ready":
     - Invoke: `neat-knowledge-ingest file docs/specs/<product>/features/feature-{goal}-{nn}-{slug}.md --category features`
     - Log: "✓ Indexed implemented feature in project KB"
   - If "skip": Skip auto-ingest
3. **Announce completion**

**Both updates required:** Frontmatter tracks state, Status section provides build metadata.

### Step 9: Audit Prompt (If Applicable)

If 2+ implemented features AND current has `depends_on` or blast area overlaps: prompt "Run audit to verify cross-feature integration? Y/n". If Y: invoke `neat-sdd-audit`. Otherwise skip.

### Step 10: Continue Building

Build another?

## Gate Handling

**Note:** Gates only run if risk assessment determines the feature is medium or high risk. Low-risk features skip gates with logged reasoning.

**On gate failure (design or execute mode):**

1. Present gate findings (blockers, warnings)
2. Ask user: "Fix plan | Fix design | Accept as-is | Abort"
   - **Fix plan:** Return to Step 4 (writing-plans), update plan, re-run gate
   - **Fix design:** Return to Step 3 (brainstorming), update design + plan, re-run gate
   - **Accept as-is:** User acknowledges risk, proceed to next step
   - **Abort:** Stop build, feature remains `state: refined`
3. Max 3 gate attempts per step. After 3 failures, escalate to user for decision.
4. **Criteria changes:** If gate reveals feature doc criteria are wrong, surface to user, update if approved, re-run gate.
